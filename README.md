# Untanglr
**Mention:** Don't be discuraged if this project hasn't been updated in a while. I will address potential issues but the crate does not need regular updates.
Untanglr takes in a some mangled words and makes sense out of them so you dont have to. It goes through the input and splits it probabilistically into words.

# Usage
Pass the tangled words as a cli argument:
```
$ untanglr thequickbrownfoxjumpedoverthelazydog
```

Or use it in your projects:
```
TODO
```

# Installation
TODO

# Credits
I have developed this project around Derek Anderson's (wordninja)[https://github.com/keredson/wordninja] python implementation for some exercising in rust while producing something useful.
